# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel pretty confident in using for loops. I need to practice the format the for look, and make sure that I cover all of the elements required in each loop. I've noticed that sometimes I go one element below or above what the for loop requires.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

So far, while the concept was pretty  difficult to understand, I didn't find the exercises too difficult to accomplish. I've programmed in the past, so that might skew my preception of how difficult these problems are. Overall, I feel challenged but confident in my work. 

I think that as we learned alot of different methods and techniques that we've used in the past, the main issued that I will have is remembering to pull from my pool of knowledge consistently throughout this work.

Throughout this lesson, I think that most of my work as productive struggle. When learning about arrays in the last lesson, I found the arrays.length command, which really helped my work faster.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to learn Github and Git commands. I find myself forgeting what commands to use to clone a repository onto my local machine, as well as what commands to set up the remote connections from local repository to the one I have on Github. I think I need to spend more time reviewing past material so that I'm more prepared for the future. As for my Calendar, I need to spend more time in the morning practicing old concepts to make sure I remember all the concepts we'll be learning.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

No questions so far, though during my research I stumbled across "while" loops, which look very complicated to me. I think my only thought is that I'm not entirely sure if there is any difference in using a previously assigned variable inside the inialization part of the for loop, but so far, everything makes sense.
